# Hyperparameters

## Logistic Regression
- `max_iter=1000` (to ensure convergence)
- `random_state=42` (for reproducibility)

## Decision Tree
- `max_depth=10` (to prevent overfitting)
- `random_state=42` (for reproducibility)


Test-1 and Train-1 Lables used 1-5 scale. Adjusted to 0-4 to match other sets.
